# Bubble Trouble 2 Emulator

### Statement
Describe your project. Why is it interesting? Why is it interesting to you personally? What do you hope to learn? 

### Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project.

Be explicit about the techiques from the class that you will use. For example:

- Will you use data abstraction? How?
- Will you use recursion? How?
- Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? 
- Will you use object-orientation? How?
- Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? How?
- Will you use state-modification approaches? How? (If so, this should be encapsulated within objects. `set!` pretty much should only exist inside an object.)
- Will you build an expression evaluator, like we did in the symbolic differentatior and the metacircular evaluator?
- Will you use lazy evaluation approaches?

The idea here is to identify what ideas from the class you will use in carrying out your project. 

**Your project will be graded, in part, by the extent to which you adopt approaches from the course into your implementation, _and_ your discussion about this.**

### External Technologies
Our project will generate or produce sound, because the original flash game produces sounds as well. When the hook is deployed, 
a bubble is popped, or the player is hit by a bubble a specific sound that is associated with each action is prodcued. The sounds do 
not differ when the same action is performed. 

### Data Sets or other Source Materials
We are not going to be using data sets or other source materials. We are attempting to emulate the classic flash game 'Bubble trouble 2'
from scratch in order to understand and reinforce the concepts learned in this class in an applicative way. 

### Deliverable and Demonstration

What we will have at the end of this semester is are playable levels that resemble those of the original game. At the live demo, we 
we will be able to run our racket code and have observers play the levels that we have successfully emulated. The player will be able 
to deploy the hook with the space bar, move the characcter with the arrow keys, and interact with objects successfully in the game 
itself. 

What will be produced at the end of the project is and interactive deliverable that anyone can play on- which will produce the same 
results no matter who is playing it. This means that the project will work to the means that we have specified in our code as well 
as our proposal, where no matter how the user interacts with our project it will not break. 

### Evaluation of Results
We will know that we are successful if we can reproduce one level from the game with some margin of similarity, with the most
simple level (level 1) successfully emulated. We will be successful if we can produce level 1 from 'Bubble trouble 2' that uses the 
same user inputs as the game, produces the same results when the imputs are used, and dose not break when other imputs are selected. 

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)
Which portion of the work will be completed (and committed to Github) by this day? 

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)
Which portion of the work will be completed (and committed to Github) by this day?  

### Public Presentation (Mon Apr 24, Wed Apr 26, or Fri Apr 28 [your date to be determined later])
What additionally will be completed before the public presentation?

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

Please use Github properly: each individual must make the edits to this file representing their own section of work.



In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.
